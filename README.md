# NeuroRaga
NeuroRāga is a student-founded application exploring the intersection of
Neuroscience and Carnatic music.

The project reimagines Carnatic ragas through a cognitive
lens, supporting purposeful engagement with music as a tool for awareness and reflection.

## Why NeuroRāga
Carnatic music encodes rich emotional and rhythmic structures that closely parallel the brain's processing of attention and emotion. NeuroRāga makes these structures accessible, enabling students and modern listeners to engage with this tradition intentionally and reflectively.

## Status
Early public version; actively evolving.

## Creator
Samhita Tumuluri  
Founder of NeuroRāga
