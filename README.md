# NeuroRaga
NeuroRāga is a student-founded application exploring the intersection of
Neuroscience and Carnatic music.

The project reimagines Carnatic ragas through a cognitive
lens, supporting purposeful engagement with music as a tool for awareness and reflection.

## Why NeuroRāga
Carnatic music encodes rich emotional and rhythmic structures that closely parallel the brain's processing of attention and emotion. NeuroRāga makes these structures accessible, enabling students and modern listeners to engage with this tradition intentionally and reflectively.

## What NeuroRāga Does
- Translates emotional states into underlying cognitive and neural needs, guiding users toward appropriate Carnatic rāgas
- Provides clear and educational explanations of how musical structure relates to attention, emotion, and regulation (non-clinical)
- Designed for students and learners seeking a reflective, intentional way to engage with music

## Status
Early public version; actively evolving.
